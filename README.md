Keylogger Project 🚀

A keylogger is a type of software that records every keystroke made on a device ⌨️. 
It captures user input, which can include passwords 🔑, messages 💬, and other sensitive information 📄. 
Keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity 👔 or parental control 👨‍👩‍👧, but they are often associated with malicious intent, such as data theft 💰 and privacy invasion 🚨.
They can be implemented as software or hardware 🖥️, making them versatile tools for both ethical and unethical uses. 
Understanding keyloggers is essential for maintaining digital security 🔒 and privacy! 🌐✨
